Belief states are a representation of all possible world states that it might be in to handle **uncertainty**. The **rational decision** depends on bot the relative importance of various goals and the likelihood they will be achieved. Probability provides a way of summarizing the uncertainty. **Utility theory** is used to represent and reason with preferences. **Decision Theory** combines both probability theory and utility theory. The idea of decision theory is that an agent is rational if and only if it chooses the action that yields the highest expected utility, averaged over the all the possible outcomes of the action. This can be called $MEU$ or **maximum expected utility**.
