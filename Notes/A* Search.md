This [[Search Algorithm]] evaluates nodes by combining $g(n)$, the cost to reach the node, and $h(n)$, the cost to get from the node to the goal. $f(n)=g(n)+h(n)$. Since $g(n)$ gives the path from the start node to node *n*, and the $h(n)$ is the estimated cost of the cheapest path from *n* to the goal, we have the estimated cost of the cheapest solution through *n*. 

It's identical to [[Uniform-Cost Search]] except A* uses $g+h$ instead of $g$. 

## Optimization
____
The first condition we require for optimality is that $h(n)$ be an **admissible** heuristic. An **admissible heuristic is one that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal**. Because g(n) is the actual cost to reach n along the current path, and $f (n) = g(n) + h(n)$, we have as an immediate consequence that $f(n)$ never overestimates the true cost of a solution along the current path through *n*.

A second, slightly stronger condition called **consistency** (or sometimes **monotonicity**) is required only for applications of A* to graph search. A heuristic $h(n)$ is consistent if, for every node $n$ and every successor $n^′$ of $n$ generated by any action $a$, the estimated cost of reaching the goal from $a$ is no greater than the step cost of getting to $n′$ plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from $n′$

$h(n) ≤ c(n, a, n′) + h(n′)$.

A* has the following properties: the tree-search version of A* is optimal if h(n) is admissible, while the graph-search version is optimal if h(n) is consistent.
