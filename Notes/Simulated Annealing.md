A hill-climbing algorithm that never makes "downhill" movement towards a state with lower value is going to be *incomplete*. This is because it gets stuck on a *local maxima*. A **purely random walk** moving to a successor chosen uniformly at random from the set of successors is complete but *extremely inefficient*. You can combine hill climbing with a random walk to yield both efficiency and completeness. This algorithm starts at a **high temperature** and then gradually reduces the temperature. Instead of picking the *best move* it picks a *random move*. It will always accept if it improves the situation. The probability decreases exponentially with worst moves. The probability also decreases as the temperature $T$ goes down. Bad moves are more likely when $T$ is high, and unlikely when $T$ decreases.
