This is a variant of stochastic beam search from [[Local Beam Search]]. Successor states are 
generated by *combining two parent states* rather than modifying a single state.

Genetic Algorithm because with a set of $k$ randomly generated states, called the **population**. Each states or **individual** is represented as a string over a finite alphabet - most commonly, a string of 0s and 1s. **Fitness function** returns higher values for better states. In a 8-queens problem, the number would be non-attacking pairs of queens. It is often the case that the population is quite diverse early on in the process, so crossover (like simulated annealing) frequently takes large steps in the state space early in the search process and smaller steps later on when most individuals are quite similar.
