## [[Conditional Probability]]
_____
**Prior Probabilities** or **Unconditional**: Refers to degrees of belief in position in the absence of any other information. For example, $P(Total=11)$ when rolling two fair dice. 

When **evidence** is given, you can calculate the **posterior** or the **conditional** probability. Given that the first dice roles a 5, what is the probability of rolling another 5. $P(double |Die_1=5)$. "|" is pronounced given. 

$P(a|b)=\frac{P(a,b)}{P(b)}$ when $P(b)>0$

## [[The Product Rule]]
_____
$P(a,b) = P(a|b)P(b)$
