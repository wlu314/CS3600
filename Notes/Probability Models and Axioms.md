## Sample Space $\Omega$
____
Set of all possible outcomes. For example, if you're flipping a coin, the sample space is $\{H,T \}$. The sample space is **collectively exhaustive** (all outcomes must be achievable) and **mutually exclusive**.  

**Continuous Example** 
____
Given a graph, the sample space for a dart game is continuous as it can land anywhere within the graph. $\Omega =\{(x,y) | 0 \le x,y \le 1\}$. There are infinitely many real numbers. The sample space is an infinite set. 

## Probability Axioms
____
**Events**: subsets within the sample space. **Probabilities** are assigned to events which are the likelihood of the event occurring. 

**Axioms:** 
- **Non negativity:** $P(A) \ge 0$
- **Normalization:** $P(\Omega)=1$
- **Additivity:** If $A\cap B = \emptyset$ , then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) +P(B)$
