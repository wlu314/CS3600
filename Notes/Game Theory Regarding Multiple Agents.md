# How is Game Theory Used
_____
**Agent Design**: GM can analyze agent's decision and compute the expected utility for each decision (assuming that other agent is acting optimally according to GM). 
**Mechanism Design**: When inhabited by many agents, it can define the rules of the environment so that the collective good of all agents is maximized when each agent adopts the game theoretic solution that maximizes its own utility.
