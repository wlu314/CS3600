## What is AI? 
___
A system is rational if it does the "right sequence" of things given information.

**Thinking Humanly**
___
"The automation of activities that we associate with human thinkings, activities such as decision-making, problem solving, learning ..." (Bellman, 1978)

There are three ways to determine how humans think. **Introspection** (Trying to catch our own thought as they go by), **Psychological Experiments** (Observing a person in action), and **Brain Imaging** (observing the brain in action). Not only is getting the answer is important, understanding the input-output behavior of the machine is important as well. 

**Thinking Rationally**
___
"The study of computations that makes it possible to perceive, reasons and act." (Winston, 1992) 

The laws of thought were supposed to govern the operation of the mind, this is the field called **logic**. 

**Acting Humanly**
____
"The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when perform by people." (Kurzweil, 1990). 

The **Turing Test**, proposed by Alan Turing, was designed to provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence. A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer. The computer needs to posses the following: 
	**Natural Language Processing**: Ability to communicate in English
	**Knowledge Representation**: To store what it knows or hears
	**Automated Reasoning**: To use stored information to answer questions and new conclusions
	**Machine Learning**: To adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

The **Total Turing Test** includes a video signal so that the interrogator can test the subjects perceptual abilities. To pass this test, a computer needs **Computer Vision** (to perceive objects) and **robotics** (to manipulate objects). 

**Acting Rationally**
___
"Computational Intelligence is the study of the design of intelligence agents" (Poole et al., 1998) 

An **agent** is something that acts. A **rational agent** is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or the best expect outcome. Making correct inferences is somethings part of being a rational agent.

## History of AI
**Gestation of AI (1943-1955)**
___
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts used the knowledge of basic physiology and functions of neurons,  formal analysis of propositional logic, and Turing's theory of computation. They proposed a model of artificial neurons in which each neuron is characterized as being "on" or "off". This switch occurs in response to stimulation by a sufficient number of neighboring neuron. They showed, any computable function could be computed by some network of connected neurons, and logical connectives could be implemented by simple net structure. They proposed that the defined networks can learn. This is called **Hebbian Learning**. 

The **Bayesian** network formalism was invented to allow efficient representation of, and rigorous reasoning with, uncertain knowledge. This approach largely overcomes many problems of the probabilistic reasoning systems of the 1960s and 1970s; it now dominates AI research on uncertain reason- ing and expert systems. The approach allows for learning from experience, and it combines the best of classical AI and neural nets

Despite these successes, some influential founders of AI, including John McCarthy (2007), Marvin Minsky (2007), Nils Nilsson (1995, 2005) and Patrick Winston (Beal and Winston, 2009), have expressed discontent with the progress of AI. They think that AI should put less emphasis on creating ever-improved versions of applications that are good at a spe- cific task, such as driving a car, playing chess, or recognizing speech. Instead, they believe AI should return to its roots of striving for, in Simon’s words, “machines that think, that learn and that create.” They call the effort human-level AI or HLAI; their first symposium was in 2004 (Minsky et al., 2004). The effort will require very large knowledge bases; Hendler et al. (1995) discuss where these knowledge bases might come from.

A related idea is the subfield of Artificial General Intelligence or AGI (Goertzel and Pennachin, 2007), which held its first conference and organized the Journal of Artificial Gen- eral Intelligence in 2008. AGI looks for a universal algorithm for learning and acting in any environment, and has its roots in the work of Ray Solomonoff (1964), one of the atten- dees of the original 1956 Dartmouth conference.
