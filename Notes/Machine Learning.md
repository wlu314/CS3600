# Type of Learning
____
There are three types of feedback that determine the 3 types of learning. In **unsupervised learning** the agent learns patterns in the input even though no feedback is supplied. **[[Clustering]]** is a common unsupervised learning task. Clustering detected potential useful cluster of input example. 

In **[[Reinforcement Learning]]**, the agent learns form a series of reinforcements - rewards or punishments. For example, the lack of a tip at the end of a taxi trip indicates that something went wrong during the trip. 

In **[[Supervised Learning]]** the agent observes some example input-output pairs and learns a function that maps from input to output. Inputs are percepts.
