## The Formula
____
$$P(H|E)=\frac{P(H)\cdot P(E|H)}{P(E)}$$
$P(H)$: Probability the hypothesis is true before any evidence. This is also known as the "Prior".
$P(E)$: Probability of seeing the evidence
$P(H|E)$: Probability the hypothesis is true given some evidence. Called the "Posterior"
$P(E|H)$: Probability of the evidence if the hypothesis is true. Called the "Likelihood".
